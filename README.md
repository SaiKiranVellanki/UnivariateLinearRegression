# Univariate Linear Regression Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing and understanding Univariate Linear Regression. It demonstrates the basic concepts of linear regression using a single predictor variable. The Jupyter notebook contains a step-by-step guide that covers the theoretical background, data preparation, model implementation, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a Jupyter notebook that includes both the explanation of key concepts in markdown cells and the practical implementation in code cells.

- **Markdown Cells**: Provide a detailed explanation of the univariate linear regression concepts, data visualization, and interpretation of the results.
- **Code Cells**: Contain Python code that demonstrates data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
